In 2019, we want to challenge Canadians to pause and think, learn about, share, and work towards solving issues that affect us all on a global scale – while leveraging the power of technology!  More information on monthly themes [here](https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/monthly-themes/)

*January's theme is FUTURES.*
