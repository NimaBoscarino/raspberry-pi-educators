      #Specific Examples + Instructions

      ##Do the Robot (slide 8)
      Follow the Do the Robot <a href="https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/lessons/do-the-robot/">lesson plan</a>, including the extensions. Recommended tasks: High-five, Jumping Jack

      ##Scratch Editor (slide 16)
      Open up the editor and point out the main features: Scripts, Sprites, and Stage. Demonstrate how to scroll between scripts, drag them over and connect them together, and delete them.

      ##Scratch Extensions (slide 17)
      Click on the blue Extensions icon (bottom, left corner). Give an overview of each one, and demonstrate how to add extensions to our script library.

      ##Code Along Challenges (slide 19)
      After 5 mintes of trying these challenges, ask volunteers to come to the front to share their solutions with the class.

      ##Interactive Artwork activity (slide 20)
      Use the Paint with Gobo <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1iNRHYAays9qSobQ2kdNm-z1nQx3GV7x1_3masDF7V_o/edit">solution sheet</a> to guide learners through this activity.

      ##Stretch and Scuttle (slide 24)
      Use the Stretch and Scuttle <a href="https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/lessons/stretch-and-scuttle/">lesson plan</a> to facilitate this stretch break.

      ##Example Lesson Plan (slide 26 and on)
      Our recommended lesson is: Self-Driving Cars. Use the Self-Driving Cars <a href="https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/lessons/self-driving-cars/">lesson plan</a> to facilitate this lesson. <br> <em>Optional: Replace this lesson plan info with any other Scratch lesson plan from the Teachers Learning Code website, including: Wildlife Soundscapes, Canada Takes Flight, or Doodle4Google. See the "Studio" section of our <a href="https://scratch.mit.edu/classes/45154/">Scratch Class</a> for options. All starter projects are already included. </em>
<!--
      ##2019 Themes (slide 27)
      <strong>Note: In 2019, we want to challenge Canadians to pause and think, learn about, share, and work towards solving issues that affect us all on a global scale - while leveraging the power of technology!<br> January's theme is Futures, with this Scratch for Educators lesson as the recommended content. We want to encourage learners to share their projects using the info linked to this slide.</strong>
-->
      ##Assessment Considerations (slide 36)
      Have learners use these points for discussion in their table groups. Use the example of the chosen Scratch lesson plan, or another one they have in mind. Loop back after 5 minutes to share with the class.

      ##How do we assess learning in Scratch? (slide 37)
      Give learners a few minutes to explore the resources linked.

      ##Lesson Planning (slide 39)
      Give learners 45 minutes to lesson plan either on their own or in pairs. You may want to move learners based off of grade levels or subject areas so that they can collaborate with educators of a similar focus.

      ##Show and Tell (slide 40)
      Save time for volunteers to share what they are working on (doesn't need to be finished!)

      ##Deconstructing Code (slides 41-42)
      Use the Deconstructing Code <a href="https://www.canadalearningcode.ca/lessons/deconstructing-code/">lesson plan</a>.

      ##Stretch Goal: Debugging (slides 43-44)
      If you have time! Walk through the first example as a group, then give learners time to try debugging on their own or in pairs. Regroup and go over any challenges that learners weren't able to solve. Have volunteers come up to help solve these when possible.

      ##Next Steps (slide 46)
      Encourage learners to write their next step on a post-it note and stick it on a wall before leaving.
